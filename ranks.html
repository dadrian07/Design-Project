        <p class="p2">There are three playlists in Competitive Rocket League, which can be discovered by choosing Play then Competitive. <br><br>Standard 3v3<br> Doubles 2v2<br> Duel 1v1 <br><br>You will be assigned a rank for each game mode. For example, if you play more 3v3 Standard, you might be Diamond there, but you're only Gold in Duel since you're not as good at 1v1 matches. When playing competitively, you must first complete ten placement games before being assigned to your desired rank. Rocket League will use the placement games to figure out how good you are and then match you up with other players of similar skill levels. You must play 10 games every playlist for a total of 30 games until you have earned three different Rocket League rankings.</p>
