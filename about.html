        <p class="p2">Psyonix developed and released Rocket League, a vehicular soccer video game. The game was first released in July 2015 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4, with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch adaptations following later. 505 Games began selling a physical retail edition of the game for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2016, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over by the end of 2017. In 2016, macOS and Linux versions were released, however support for their online services was discontinued in 2020. In September 2020, the game became completely free to play.<br><br> Rocket League is a follow-up to Psyonix's 2008 PlayStation 3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Battle-Cars had mixed reviews and was not a commercial success, but it did attract a devoted following. While working on a sequel, Psyonix continues to fund themselves by doing contract development work for other studios. Around 2013, Psyonix began formal development on Rocket League, refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars in response to criticism and fan feedback. Psyonix also acknowledged the game's lack of marketing and used social media and promotions to promote it, including giving the game away for free to PlayStation Plus subscribers when it was released.</p>
