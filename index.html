            <p>Rocket League is described as "soccer with rocket-powered cars," with each team having up to eight players who use rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and collect points throughout the course of a match. The game has single-player and multiplayer modes that may be played locally or online, as well as cross-platform play across all platforms. Later updates to the game provided the option to change primary rules and various game modes, including ice hockey and basketball-themed ones..</p>
